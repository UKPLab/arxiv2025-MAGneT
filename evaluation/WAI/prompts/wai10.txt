Question: The client and counselor have different ideas about what the client’s real problems are.

Score 2: There is considerable agreement on the client’s true problems. The counselor is willing to explore client problems and current feelings, and the client openly follows and/or provides the direction of the discussion.
Score 3: Participants show some agreement about the issues that the client faces.
Score 4: No evidence or equal evidence regarding agreement and/or disagreement.
Score 5: Participants show some disagreement about what the client’s problems are. Either may question the other’s response regarding client problems.
Score 6: One participant brings up a topic but the other ignores it or disagrees with its relevance. Confrontations of some sort arise as a result. There may be signs that one or both participants become defensive at times.
Score 7: Client either strongly disagrees or argues with counselor about what his/her problems really are. The counselor may refer to what he/she believes is the “real problem” and may thereby discount the client’s perceptions of the problem. The counselor abruptly shifts topics and/or constantly interrupts with no regard for the client’s concerns or current state.
